To tackle the problem of predicting fraudulent transactions for a financial company, we need to follow a systematic approach that involves data preparation, model development, and model evaluation. 

### Data Preparation
### Model Development
### Variable Selection
### Model Performance
### Key Factors and Interpretation
### Prevention Measures
### Post-Implementation Evaluation

By following this structured approach, we can develop an effective fraud detection model, implement actionable prevention strategies, and continuously evaluate and improve the system's performance.
